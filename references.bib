            location, scale, correlation, and a resistant regression line.

            the relevant parameters. Additional properties are given and

  abstract= {We propose the bagplot, a bivariate generalization of the
            univariate boxplot. The key notion is the halfspace location
            depth of a point relative to a bivariate dataset, which extends
            the univariate concept of rank. The "depth median" is the deepest
            location, and it is surrounded by a "bag" containing the n/2
            observations with largest depth. Magnifying the bag by a factor 3
            yields the "fence" (which is not plotted). Observations between
            the bag and the fence are marked by a light gray loop, whereas
            observations outside the fence are flagged as outliers. The
            bagplot visualizes the location, spread, correlation, skewness,
            and tails of the data. It is equivariant for linear
            transformations, and not limited to elliptical distributions.
            Software for drawing the bagplot is made available for the S-Plus
            and MATLAB environments. The bagplot is illustrated on several
            datasets-for example, in a scatterplot matrix of multivariate
            data.},

            length based on box, line, and midgap plots. For each type of
            graph, a different sample of undergraduates viewed 48 single-plot
            graphs. For each plot, subjects were given the length of an
            interquartile spread and asked to estimate the length of a
            whisker. Plots varied in spatial orientation (horizontal or
            vertical), interquartile spread, the ratio of whisker length to
            interquartile spread, and whisker judged. Overall, estimates of
            whisker length for box and line plots were more accurate and less
            biased than those for midgap plots. Interquartile spread, the
            ratio of whisker length to interquartile spread, and the
            interaction of these two factors significantly influenced both
            accuracy and bias. Boxplots displayed a predicted pattern of
            over- and underestimation. We discuss how the present results
            complement related work of others (e.g., Cleveland & McGill,
            1984) on depiction of quantity. We conclude that midgap plots are
            less optimal displays than box and line plots. }
