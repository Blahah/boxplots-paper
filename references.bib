            univariate data. Several options of bivariate boxplot-type
            constructions are discussed. These include both elliptic and
            asymmetric plots. An inner region contains 50% of the data, and a
            fence identifies potential outliers. Such a robust plot shows
            location, scale, correlation, and a resistant regression line.
            Alternative constructions are compared in terms of efficiency of
            the relevant parameters. Additional properties are given and
            recommendations made. Emphasis is given to the bivariate biweight
            M estimator. Several practical examples illustrate that standard
            least squares ellipsoids can give graphically misleading
            summaries.}

  abstract= {Examined here were the accuracy and bias of estimates of whisker
            length based on box, line, and midgap plots. For each type of
            graph, a different sample of undergraduates viewed 48 single-plot
            graphs. For each plot, subjects were given the length of an
            interquartile spread and asked to estimate the length of a
            whisker. Plots varied in spatial orientation (horizontal or
            vertical), interquartile spread, the ratio of whisker length to
            interquartile spread, and whisker judged. Overall, estimates of
            whisker length for box and line plots were more accurate and less
            biased than those for midgap plots. Interquartile spread, the
            ratio of whisker length to interquartile spread, and the
            interaction of these two factors significantly influenced both
            accuracy and bias. Boxplots displayed a predicted pattern of
            over- and underestimation. We discuss how the present results
            complement related work of others (e.g., Cleveland & McGill,
            1984) on depiction of quantity. We conclude that midgap plots are
            less optimal displays than box and line plots. }
